## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

## My Laravel Project
I'm creating a simple Laravel website with a minimalist design. It has four main sections: Home, Blog, About, and Contact.

## Home 
![HOME](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ed30b2d-b7cd-412f-9d44-4eba8ee429b4)
This is the homepage. I want tell about Pahang where I study so Iâ€™ve added a picture of Teluk cempedak. 

## Blog
![BLOG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/823878da-65ac-4519-b8c0-27b5ed5fee5c)

This is the blog page of a personal website. It features two blog posts written by Anis Talib. The first post is about Pahang, a state in Malaysia known for its natural beauty. The second post is about Kuantan 188, a landmark in Kuantan, the capital city of Pahang. Both posts have links to read more.

## About 
![ABOUT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0708577-f670-4b1b-b00e-79be935e22d3)
The page you're looking at is the "About" page. It is mostly about the me which is the owner of this website. Also it has a picture of me and my friends. 

## Contact
![CONTACT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c9e6fb3-6568-4278-b097-aeaa68f2084a)
This is the contact page. It has a simple layout like the others. The header contains the website's navigation links, which will go to Instagram page when you click Instgram and vice versa.
